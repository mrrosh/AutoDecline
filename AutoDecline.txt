AutoDecline v1.3.1600
by Pacer Dawn (pacer.dawn@earthlink.net)
_______________________________________________________________________________

This modification to the WoW interface allows a player to automatically decline (block) incoming guild invites, party invites, duel invitations, and guild charters.

Type /ad, /autod, or /autodecline to bring up the options window, which will allow you to turn on or off which invites are automatically declined or not.  Place a check mark beside each option to decline, or clear the option to accept those requests.  Options are stored by character.  The default is to block all invites except for party invites.


ACTIONS________________________________________________________________________

You can define a series of slash commands to execute when an autodecline is triggered.  There are seperate actions for each of the autodecline types (party/duel/charter/guild).  To define an action for a decline type, use the following command line syntax:

/autodecline {actiontype} {action}

Where "{actiontype}" is one of the following: partyaction, duelaction, guildaction, charteraction, for party, duel, guild, and charter declines respectively.  "{action}" is a slash command to perform when the invite is declined.  This can be any legal slash command, and multiple commands can be defined.

/autodecline {actiontype} remove {#}

Using this command will remove the action in slot {#} from the list of actions for action {actiontype}.

/autodecline {actiontype} list - List all actions

Using this command will list all of the actions defined for action {actiontype}.

There are two variables that can be used in the slash commands:

$player - this will be replaced with the name of the player being declined
$guild - for charters and guild invites, this will be replaced with the name of the guild

So, for example, the following could be defined for declining charters:

/autodecline charteraction /whisper $player Sign a charter for $guild?  It's considered polite to ask first...
/autodecline charteraction /rude $player
/autodecline charteraction /ignore $player

This will send a whisper to the player giving you the charter, your character will then perform an emote to that player, and the player will be put on the ignore list.

REVISIONS______________________________________________________________________

v1.3.1600 ** 08/14/2005

  -Added more opportunities to get the player name.
  -Changed command processing to allow turning debug mode on even if player name wasn't found
  -Now unregisters events if the mod cannot be executed (due to missing player name for example)
  -Made a change to the options screen to better indicate that checking party/guild/duel/charter meant that those types of requests would be declined
  -Originally, you were supposed to be able to toggle the base decline settings by not specifying "on" or "off" on the command line.  However, I had a variable named incorrectly so that wasn't working.  That should work now.  Example, "/autodecline party" should toggle declining party invites on and off each time it is executed.
  -To allow for future enhancement, the command line switches for maintaining the party allowed list were changed in the following way:
  "/autodecline partyadd" was changed to "/autodecline partyplayer add"
  "/autodecline partyremove" was changed to "/autodecline partyplayer remove"
  "/autodecline partylist" was changed to "/autodecline partyplayer list"
  -The options screen was enhanced to better indicate that the check values for the decline options meant that by checking them, you would be automatically declining that type of request.
  -All text from the options screen has been moved to the localization.lua file.
  -A new toggle has been added to allow invites from members of your guild.
    /autodecline partyguild on - This will always allow party invites from members of your guild
    /autodecline partyguild off - This will turn off always allowing party invites from members of your guild
  -A new option has been added to the options screen to use the current settings for all characters.
  -New commands have been added to maintain a list of slash commands (actions) to perform when something is declined.
